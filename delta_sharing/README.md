# Delta Sharing Connector Example

A Fivetran Connector SDK connector that syncs data from any [Delta Sharing](https://delta.io/sharing)-compatible server into your Fivetran destination.

## Connector overview

Delta Sharing is an open protocol for secure, real-time exchange of large datasets across platforms. This connector discovers all shares, schemas, and tables exposed by a Delta Sharing server and syncs them into a single Fivetran destination schema.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/community_connectors/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)
- A Delta Sharing recipient profile (see [Authentication](#authentication))

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```
fivetran init --template delta_sharing
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`. For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/connector-development-and-configuration/connector-sdk-commands#fivetraninit).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.


## Configuration file

The connector reads credentials from `configuration.json`. It supports two authentication methods, selected with the `auth_type` field.

### Bearer token (default)

```json
{
  "endpoint": "<YOUR_DELTA_SHARING_ENDPOINT>",
  "auth_type": "bearer_token",
  "bearer_token": "<YOUR_DELTA_SHARING_TOKEN>"
}
```

### OAuth 2.0 client credentials

```json
{
  "endpoint": "<YOUR_DELTA_SHARING_ENDPOINT>",
  "auth_type": "oauth_client_credentials",
  "token_endpoint": "<YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT>",
  "client_id": "<YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET>",
  "scope": "<YOUR_OAUTH_SCOPE>"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `endpoint` | Yes | Base URL of the Delta Sharing server (e.g. `https://sharing.example.com/delta-sharing`) |
| `auth_type` | No | Authentication method: `bearer_token` (default) or `oauth_client_credentials` |
| `bearer_token` | Conditional | Bearer token used to authenticate requests. Required when `auth_type` is `bearer_token` |
| `token_endpoint` | Conditional | OAuth token endpoint URL. Required when `auth_type` is `oauth_client_credentials` |
| `client_id` | Conditional | OAuth client ID. Required when `auth_type` is `oauth_client_credentials` |
| `client_secret` | Conditional | OAuth client secret. Required when `auth_type` is `oauth_client_credentials` |
| `scope` | No | OAuth scope requested during the client credentials flow |


## Requirements File

`requirements.txt` lists Python packages installed into the connector runtime at deploy time:

```
delta-sharing   # Official Delta Sharing Python client — handles DeletionVectors, incremental reads, and all advanced Delta table features
pyarrow         # Columnar data processing for Parquet file reads
```

> **Why `delta-sharing` instead of raw HTTP?**  
> Tables that use Delta features such as `enableDeletionVectors` cannot be read via the standard parquet query API (the server returns HTTP 400). The `delta_sharing` library handles these transparently using the `responseformat=delta` protocol capability.

> Note: [Some packages](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/technical-reference#preinstalledpackages) are pre-installed in the Connector SDK runtime environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`. 


## Authentication

Delta Sharing supports two authentication methods. Select one with the `auth_type` field in `configuration.json`.

### Bearer token

Both the endpoint URL and the bearer token are distributed to recipients via an activation link provided by the data provider.

#### How to obtain credentials

1. The data provider shares a dataset with you as a recipient in their Delta Sharing platform (e.g. Databricks Unity Catalog).
2. They send you an activation link — a one-time URL that, when opened, downloads a profile file (`.share` or `.json`).
3. The profile file contains:
    
    ```json
    {
      "shareCredentialsVersion": 1,
      "bearerToken": "<your-bearer-token>",
      "endpoint": "<sharing-server-endpoint>",
      "expirationTime": "2027-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
    ```

4. Copy the `bearerToken` and `endpoint` values from the profile file into `configuration.json`.

> Note: The bearer token has an expiration time. When it expires, request a new activation link from the data provider and update `configuration.json` and redeploy.

### OAuth 2.0 client credentials

For Delta Sharing servers that support OAuth (for example, Databricks Unity Catalog OIDC-based sharing), set `auth_type` to `oauth_client_credentials` and provide the `token_endpoint`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, and optional `scope`. The connector runs the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow to obtain a short-lived access token, caches it, and refreshes it automatically before it expires, so no manual token rotation is required.

## Pagination
This connector does not use API pagination for table rows. It discovers the table list first, then processes each table one by one, and performs record-level checkpointing every CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL rows plus a checkpoint after each table. This keeps progress durable and allows safe resume behavior across large sync runs.

## Data handling
Catalog metadata is synced into `shares`, `schemas`, and `tables`, while data tables are written as `{schema}__{table}`. On first sync, it loads a full snapshot; on later syncs, it loads only changes between versions and keeps insert/update-postimage records. Null-like pandas values are normalized to None, and state is advanced per table version only after successful writes.

## Error handling
Configuration is validated early with clear `ValueError` messages for missing or invalid fields. Per-table failures (version lookup or data load) are logged as warnings and skipped so other tables can continue syncing. A `finally` block always removes the temporary Delta Sharing profile file, ensuring cleanup even when errors occur.

## Tables created

Destination layout:

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `shares` | Names of all shares accessible to the recipient |
| `schemas` | Names of all schemas found across those shares |
| `tables` | Catalog of all tables (share, schema, name) |
| `{schema}__{table}` | Actual data — one table per shared table (e.g. `customers__account`) |
