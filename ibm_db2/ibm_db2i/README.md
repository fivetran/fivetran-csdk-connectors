# IBM Db2 for i Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector allows you to sync data from an IBM Db2 for i (IBM i / AS400) database to a destination using the Fivetran Connector SDK. The connector uses the IBM i Access ODBC Driver via `pyodbc` to establish a connection to your IBM i system, reads data from the `CUSTOMER` table in batches, and upserts the rows to the destination. The first sync fetches all rows, while subsequent syncs are incremental and fetch only rows where `UPDATE_TIMESTAMP` is greater than the highest value seen in the previous sync.

This example connector demonstrates extracting customer data but can be modified to work with any IBM i table.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/community_connectors/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)
- IBM i Access ODBC Driver installed on the host running the connector — see [Additional files](#additional-files) for the installation script

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```
fivetran init --template ibm_db2/ibm_db2i
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`. For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/connector-development-and-configuration/connector-sdk-commands#fivetraninit).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.

## Features

- Connects to a IBM Db2 for i database using the IBM i Access ODBC Driver
- Verifies TCP connectivity before opening the ODBC connection
- Fetches rows in configurable batches for memory-efficient syncs
- Checkpoints every 10,000 rows to support resumable syncs

## Configuration file

The connector uses a `configuration.json` file to define the connection parameters for the IBM i database. The connection parameters required are:

```json
{
    "hostname": "<YOUR_IBM_I_HOSTNAME>",
    "port": "<YOUR_IBM_I_PORT>",
    "database": "<YOUR_IBM_I_DATABASE>",
    "user_id": "<YOUR_IBM_I_USER_ID>",
    "password": "<YOUR_IBM_I_PASSWORD>"
}
```

The configuration parameters are:
- `hostname` (required): The hostname or IP address of your IBM i system.
- `port` (required): The port number for the IBM i Access ODBC connection (typically `8471`).
- `database` (required): The IBM i library/schema name used for both the ODBC connection and the SQL schema qualifier.
- `user_id` (required): The username to authenticate with the IBM i system.
- `password` (required): The password to authenticate with the IBM i system.
- `timeout_seconds` (optional): TCP connectivity check timeout in seconds. Defaults to `60`.

> Note: When submitting connector code as a [Community Connector](https://github.com/fivetran/community_connectors/tree/main) in the open-source [Connector SDK repository](https://github.com/fivetran/community_connectors/tree/main), ensure the `configuration.json` file has placeholder values. When adding the connector to your production repository, ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python libraries required by the connector. The `requirements.txt` file contains:

```
pyodbc==5.2.0
```

> Note: [Some packages](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/technical-reference#preinstalledpackages) are pre-installed in the Connector SDK runtime environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector uses direct database authentication with a `user_id` and `password`. These credentials are specified in the `configuration.json` file and passed to `pyodbc` when building the ODBC connection string. The IBM i Access ODBC Driver handles authentication with the IBM i system.

To obtain the required credentials:

1. Log in to your IBM i system using an administrator profile.
2. Create a user profile with the necessary permissions to read from the target library and tables.
3. Note the system hostname or IP address and the port used for IBM i Access ODBC connections (typically `8471`).
4. Record the library (database) name you want to query as the `database` value in your configuration.
5. Use the user profile name and password as the `user_id` and `password` values in your configuration.

## Data handling

The connector performs the following data handling operations:
- Verifies TCP connectivity to the IBM i host before opening the ODBC connection
- Establishes an ODBC connection using the IBM i Access ODBC Driver
- Normalizes column names to lowercase before upserting to the destination
- Processes and upserts rows in batches of 1000

Incremental sync:
- On the first sync, all rows are fetched (full load)
- After each sync, the highest `UPDATE_TIMESTAMP` value seen is saved to state as `customer_last_update_timestamp`
- On subsequent syncs, only rows where `UPDATE_TIMESTAMP` is greater than `customer_last_update_timestamp` are fetched, ordered by `UPDATE_TIMESTAMP` ascending
- This requires the source CUSTOMER table to have an `UPDATE_TIMESTAMP` column that is updated whenever a row is modified

## Error handling

The connector implements the following error handling strategies:
- Configuration validation: Checks for all required configuration parameters before attempting connections
- TCP pre-check: Tests network reachability before opening the ODBC connection, with timing information logged on both success and failure
- Connection failures: Catches ODBC connection errors and raises a `RuntimeError` with elapsed time and the underlying exception message
- Logging: Uses the SDK logging framework to provide detailed timing information and progress updates

## Tables created

The connector creates and syncs the `CUSTOMER` table. Because the connector uses `SELECT *`, the full column set is determined at runtime by the `CUSTOMER` table on your IBM i system. Column data types are inferred by Fivetran from the values upserted.

The primary key columns for the `CUSTOMER` table are `c_d_id` and `c_id`.

Schema definition from connector:

```json
{
    "table": "customer",
    "primary_key": ["c_d_id", "c_id"]
}
```

## Additional files

The connector uses the `drivers/installation.sh` bash script that installs the IBM i Access ODBC Driver (`ibm-iaccess`) and unixODBC on Debian/Ubuntu systems. Run this script on any host where the connector will execute before running `fivetran debug` or deploying.

The `ibm-iaccess_1.1.0.29-1.0_amd64.deb` package is bundled in the connector directory and is referenced by the installation script. It is included because the target environment cannot reach IBM's download servers directly.
